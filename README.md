# What is Motor Insurance Policy
Motor Insurance is an insurance that covers the policyholder in case of financial losses resulting from an accident or other damages sustained by the insured vehicle. 
Its primary objective is to provide protection against physical damage resulting from traffic collisions and against liability that could also arise there-from.

# What does the motor insurance policy cover?

Damages and losses, resulting from natural calamities such as earthquake, floods, fire, lightning, landslide, hurricane, etc.

Damages that result from human intervention, including burglary, theft, riots, strike or any other activity born of malicious intent.

Third-party legal liabilities owing to damages (both bodily injuries and death) caused to third-party as well as financial losses to a third-party property.

# Modelling insurance claims  

Modelling insurance claims can reveal valuable information for insurance risk management. 

From the past insurance policy information, insurance claims predictive models can learn patterns of different insurance claim ratios and can be used to predict risk levels of future insurance policies.

A key challenge for the insurance industry is to charge each customer an appropriate price for the risk they represent. Risk varies widely from customer to customer, and a deep understanding of different risk factors helps predict the likelihood and cost of insurance claims. 

The goal of this project is to understand the behavior of the motor insurance claims.
